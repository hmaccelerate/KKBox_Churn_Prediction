## Planning Presentation Requirement
1.Project title with team members (and team number);

2.Use cases to be satisfied for hypothetical customers--see separate item on this under Projects;

3.Methodology (how/what do you propose to do);

4.Data sources, enumerating the magnitude (primarily the # of rows) of the data that you will process;

5.Milestones/sprints (approximately one week to ten days between each);

6.What will you program in Scala (and will there be any code not in Scala?) and where is your code repository?

7.Acceptance criteria (how will I know that you have achieved what you set out to do? -- see separate item);
